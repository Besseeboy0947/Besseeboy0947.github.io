##    My Task list App allows for the creation of user accounts by signing up, logging in and logging out with the use of sessions I was able to create a hash which essentially stored a user's inputted data securely on the server.when a user creates an account or logs in. their session is created ,password is encryted, and they are given a unique id that is specific to thier donation in the App. They then are able to utlize crud actions by creating, reading ,updating or deleting or just deleting their stored links.
##                I really enjoyed completing this project and felt i learned alot more and at a much better pace then in the begging with the cli project. I also felt much more comfortable than when i was working on the first project. Overall this project was challenging still in a good way. Even after about four and a half months i am impressed with my ability to build a simple website from nothing although i still have a lot to learn & a very long way to go, it's good to complete a project from scratch, another step in my web development journey feels pretty cool. Sinatra is a big step even thow i have much to learn, My ability to break down a lesson and keep working at it is getting a whole lot better. I still need to work on blogging more often and writing down my thoughts and ideas but i can say my future in web development is looking bright.**
