This post is regarding my Now-Playing CLI project.
It's a command line app that will display a list of movies i scraped from fandango.com, using Nokogiri & open-uri.
This app is probably useless to most people, as the data probably only pertains to people that are intereted in Movies, though it was still fun to make, and pretty frustrating as well. I would assume alot of people do projects based on things they are interested in. I choose to do this project on something I found interesting just to keep myslef intrested and motivated to complete the project. 


As frustrated as i got trying to understand different concepts and going back into sections to remind myself how ruby objects work. I continuously had to reminded myself that learning is the number one goal at hand, not building the best program, or being hard on myself, Because didn't have the best code. I believe the fog will clear up and it's all part of the process.

To get started i decided to create a Ruby Gem which provides a command line interface to view recent movies & there descriptions. After reading and watching the provided materials, I got started. This project had its obvious benefits, such as helping me improve my programming skills, but one of the greatest benefits for me was utilizing the git commads, which I had no previous experience doing.

I think writing down everything and mapping it out is an essential aspect to completing this project, which is something I didn't do at the start, but i probably should have, i later wrote up detailed list using trello. I ended up writing the list after i was advised to in a study group Because I got frustrated, as I didnâ€™t know the direction of where I was headed with my project.I also decided to go back to the CLI music library project for reference which ended helping out a lot.After a few hiccups of setting up a working environment, I found that looping through elements from my chosen website was pretty much straightforward. The curriculum to this point prepared me very well for this project and for my project all the methods were pretty easy to set up. I do however feel the important lesson here is to keep yourself discipline & motivated to finish and not being intimidated by the many task's required to complete.

Overall, it was deffinitley a learning experience. I learned alot about writing efficient code, setting my code up in a local enviornment, and to just be patient. I think the next project i have,  I will do better, and complete faster than I did on this one.
