I would say from a youth i took liking in the advancing of technology, i always had a love for being on the computer and understanding what it takes to make them work properly. I remember i was in middle school, the first time i found out i would be taking a class on how to use the keyboard of a computer. Even though it took me a while to get the hang of working the keyboard properly, i was still very pleased with the idea on doing work on the computer on a daily basis.
i started to use the computer for more hours a day then i would watch televsion. I quickly got the hang of the internet and loved more than anything listening to music and watching videos.throughout my years in highschool i was already on the path to a career in computers, at the time i was study technology computer science.
