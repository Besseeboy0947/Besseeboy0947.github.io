I would say from a youth i took liking in the advancing of technology, i always had a love for being on the computer and understanding what it takes to make them work properly. I remember i was in middle school, the first time i found out i would be taking a class on how to use the keyboard of a computer. Even though it took me a while to get the hang of working the keyboard properly, i was still very pleased with the idea on doing work on the computer on a daily basis.
i started to use the computer for more hours a day then i would watch televsion. I quickly got the hang of the internet and loved more than anything listening to music and watching videos.throughout my years in highschool i was already on the path to a career in computers, at the time i was study technology computer science. I was really happy with the experences ive had working with tech in highschool so without a doubt i went ahead and took on computer science in college. within my first year went well because it was mostly college readness course, second year i realized i didnt like the apporach i had to take to obtane a computer science degree and still possible not be able to get a job with just that.i was workin a full time job and going to school and i remember thinking that thing were hopeless till i had a friend talk to me inperson about a coding course i could take to gain enough knowledge to get me into a job in the field i want. I went on to complie as much research as i possible could find out about coding & web development. i quickly found myslef comparing different bootcamp and coding schools. Today, im glad to have the oppurinity to be apart of the Flatiron school community.
