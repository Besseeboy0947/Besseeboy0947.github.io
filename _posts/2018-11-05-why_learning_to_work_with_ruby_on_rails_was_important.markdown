While learning the language Ruby on the framework Rails i learned that you can accomplish more with less, Ruby helps better structured your code. Since the code can be re-used changes are easy, making iteration and experimentation painless. Learning Ruby on Rails helped me knock out the idea list Ive been sitting on for months. If you are building a complex website or app that involves a database then you’ll want to use Rails. Learning a new language and tool takes time and effort. So if you think that you might be able to use Ruby on a single project—and don’t think you will have to use it again—it’s probably not worth the effort of taking time to learn the skill. However, if you plan on continuing to build complex websites and applications then making the investment in learning Ruby on Rails is probably worth it.
 you'll work directly for the client. They don’t care whether you use PHP or Ruby. They just want you to build them a website that will do X, Y and Z. I know It’s my job to figure out how to effectively do It, so knowing both PHP and Ruby is a must.
