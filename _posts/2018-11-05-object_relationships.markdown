There's alot of things I've begun to understand while working with object relationships. First off there are many 
different senarios where knowledge of object relationships will come in handy, for instance think of an object.
Let's say a poke'mon. what is a poke'mon..... it's a creature from a cartoon, i thought poke'mon was a good example because most poke'mon have an owner who caught it while in the wild and every wild poke'mon has a type.
If you have ever watched Poke'mon, you've prolly seen Pikachu shoot an electric thunderbolt attack. Each pokemon belongs to a type. For example, Pikachu is an electric type, which is why Pikachu can uses a thunderbolt attack.a pokemon belongs to a type. There would be many types of poke'mon. So, A Pokemon belong to a trainer and belong to a type. A trainer has many pokemons and a type has many pokemons. A trainer has many types of pokemon and a type has many trainers through its pokemons. This is a great example of an “has-many-through” relationship.
