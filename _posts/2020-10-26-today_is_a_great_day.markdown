# Today my energy towards coding is better than ever. I feel fantastic when i look at my current project flow and i say to myself "HEY, I Built That." it's a really good feeling when you know your future is bright and your in good hands. For the past year i have had alot of stuggles with overcoming emposter sydrome, and tell myself "I AM A GOOD DEVELOPER".
# It's been hard to say that since i felt as if i wasn't making any progress in my couse and that feeling is very discouraging.
# i would like to train myself to write more blog post, and open up about the challeges i face writing code everyday.
# i think i would be a good idea for me to write about what i learned. If i run intio an errors and can't fix it write about how i will trouble shoot that error. i really wish to complete this program come december but i can tell that's all up to me.. i know my spirit is on track i just need to keep my foot on the pedal.
